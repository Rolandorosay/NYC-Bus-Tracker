# NYC Bus Tracker (Cambridge, MA)

This file was named NYC Bus Tracker but what is shown is a bus station map between MIT and Harvard. I have not decided whether to rename the repository or update the files to NYC bus routes. Moving forward I would like to explore different versions of my map. I'd like to do it based on the places I've visited and link photos to each location.

(still figuring out how to have names pop up when the bus stop ticker appears)
